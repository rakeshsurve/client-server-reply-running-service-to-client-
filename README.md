Here's the java program to check which services are running on server and client request to server  
First run the SendFile program and change the path of the cp command in the program 
After that run ReceivedFile program you can put any random name and retrive the services which are running on the server
Make sure that all the file i.e. SendFile ,ReceivedFile and the cp command destination file remains in the same folder.
Thank you...:)
